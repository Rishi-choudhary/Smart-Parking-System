# Smart Parking System

![Demo Image](demo.png)

The Smart Parking System is a web-based application designed to monitor and manage parking spaces in real-time using computer vision technology and Flask as the web server. This project is intended to help you create a smart parking management system with features like real-time status updates, reservation capabilities, and more.

## Features

- Real-time parking slot occupancy detection using OpenCV
- Web-based interface for users to check parking availability and make reservations
- Automatic reservation expiration and release of slots upon no-show
- Easy-to-use and responsive design for both desktop and mobile devices
- Admin interface for monitoring and managing parking slots
- Customizable configuration options for different parking lots

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask (web server)
- OpenCV (computer vision for real-time slot detection)
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end
- Webcam or IP camera for real-time video feed
- Access to a web server (local or remote) to host the system

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-parking-system.git
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install flask opencv-python
Modify the configuration in config.py to suit your parking lot's settings.

Start the Flask application:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Access the web application in your browser at http://localhost:5000 (by default).

Integrate the camera system to capture real-time parking lot images and update the status.

Usage
Users can visit the web application to check parking availability and make reservations.

Admins can access the admin panel by navigating to /admin to monitor and manage parking slots.

To integrate your camera system, ensure that it provides real-time images and update the /reserve route in main.py to capture and process the camera feed.
